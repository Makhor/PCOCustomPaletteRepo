# Character Folders

## How do I use these palettes?

Custom palettes are placed in the "palettes" folder in your Friend & Fairy/Petal Crash Online folder, which is inside your AppData directory (This folder is also where 
your game preferences are stored). Simply place a .txt with the name of the character, copy one of the palette codes for said character, and paste it inside the .txt.
You *need* to create the "palettes" folder, as it is not created by default.

If you wish to have all of the palettes from this repository available in your game, simply copy the contents inside the "palettes" folder into your own. The advantage of this method is that anyone
else that also uses the files from this repo will be able to see your custom palettes!
