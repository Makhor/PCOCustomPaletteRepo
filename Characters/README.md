# Character Folders

## How do I use these palettes?

Simply go to the folder of the character you wish to get a palette for, choose a palette you like, and copy the code for it.
Once you have it, you can go into your PCO directory, go to the appropiate character folder inside of data/characters, and
open the palette.txt file with Notepad++ or something similar. Then, delete one of the lines, and paste the one you have on
your clipboard. Once that's done, you can boot up the game and check it out! Also, the number of the line you replace will
also be the number of the costume in the game (Example: Line 6 corresponds to Costume 6, etc).
