## What is this for?

This repository is a community managed repository to share custom character palettes for the game "Petal Crash Online".
It is meant to be a place where members of the Friend & Fairy community can host their own custom palettes for others to use.

## How do I use these palettes in my game?
Read the README.md on your PCO directory, and check out the README.md present inside the Characters folder for some extra info.

## How can I submit palettes?

You can pull this repo and then make a pull request, following the steps detailed below.  
If you're not familiar with Git and do not know what the above meant, you can always email me at this adress: makhordev@gmail.com, or through my Discord (Makhor#1840),
and give me the palette you wish to submit so that I can add it for you, but pull requests are recommended. In either case, you still need to follow the steps below
about the format.

Once you have cloned the repo, you can add your own palette like this:
1) Grab one of the Color Indexed PNGs present on the ImagePack folder of the character you want, and apply your color palette to it.
2) Save the image to the appropiate folder in the Characters folder, and call it "Palette-.png", where the "-" should be replaced with the number of your color palette. So for example, if you want to add a Rosalia color palette, and you see that the last palette image present in the "Rosalia" folder has the number 2, then your color palette image should have the number 3.
3) Add the code for your palette in the README.md file present in the character folder, following the format of the other palettes.

Note: In the case of Lilibri/Hyper Lilibri, you need to also make images for them individually. Example: If you make a Lilibri/Hyper Lilibri color palette, you need to make two images: one of them with the color palette applied to normal Lilibri, and the other one applied to Hyper Lilibri. The file name for both of these images would be "Palette-n.png" for normal Lilibri and "Palette-h.png" for Hyper Lilibri. 

## Submission Rules
- Palettes that drastically change the skin color of POC characters will not be accepted.
- Palettes that reference any racist/homophobic/transphobic media or figures will not be accepted.
- This repo is intended to be SFW, so any palette that references NSFW media (mostly pornography) will not be accepted.

Submitted palettes that break any of these rules won't be added to the repository, and on certain cases,
will get you blacklisted from submitting to this repo, so keep that in mind.
